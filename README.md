Architecture: SOLID : MVI : Single Activity

Frameworks: Retrofit, Hilt, Coroutines, Okhttp

UI: Jetpack Compose

Tests: Unit

Instructions: Just build the project, enter a valid card number and amount.
The request is sent via Retrofit, intercepted by an interceptor (mocking the backend response).

No multi-modularity, because the project is small
